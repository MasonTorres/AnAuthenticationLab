# An Authentication Lab
Let's start with an on-premises environment that synchronises accounts to Azure Active Directory. We will add some applications that authenticate against Active Directory using AD FS - SAML, WSFed and OpenID protocols.

Our lab looks a little like this and will grow as we add capabilities.
